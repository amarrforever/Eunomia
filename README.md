# Eunomia

## Introduction
Eunomia is a project being developed at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications in collaboration with Matthew Weber and John Capozzo. The aim of the project is to answer two questions. First, are mutation transition porbaiblities indiciative of known cancer subtypes and can they be used to find more distinc cancer subtypes? Seocnd, can the MDMR algorithm developed by John and Alex Lipka, effectively pick out features to increase the predictive power of deep neural networks.
